## üêõ Known Issues

### Database
- **Legacy fields**: `yes_pool` and `no_pool` columns still exist (kept for backward compatibility, not used)
- **No database migrations**: Schema changes require manual intervention

### UI/Templates
- **Error handling**: Failed states could be better displayed with proper error pages
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Not fully optimized for mobile devices
- **Form validation**: Client-side validation is minimal

## üéØ Next Sprint Focus

1. **Market Discovery & Organization** (High Priority)
   - Add market categories/tags
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add filtering (active/resolved/by category)
   - Show market statistics (volume, traders)

2. **Trading Experience Enhancements**
   - Add slippage/price impact warnings
   - Trade history per user
   - Order validation improvements
   - Session timeout handling

3. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Better error pages and messages
   - Form validation improvements
   - Loading states for async operations
   - Mobile responsive refinements

## üìù Technical Debt

- Remove or migrate away from legacy `yes_pool`/`no_pool` database columns
- Add proper error handling middleware (currently using basic Result/String errors)
- Implement comprehensive request validation layer
- Add integration tests for trading flows
- Add end-to-end tests for critical paths
- Document API endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Add deployment documentation
- Database migration system (currently manual SQL changes)

## üîÆ Future Exploration

- Hybrid AMM + Order Book (like current Polymarket)
- Cross-chain support
- Decentralized resolution (oracle integration)
- AI-powered market suggestions
- Social features (groups, challenges)
- Tournament/competition mode
