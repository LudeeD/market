## üêõ Known Issues

### Authentication
- **No session management**: Login/logout don't actually track sessions
- **Hardcoded user ID**: All trades use `user_id = 1`
- **No logout button in UI**: Need to add logout link to templates

### Database
- **Legacy fields**: `yes_pool` and `no_pool` columns still exist (kept for backward compatibility)
- **Timestamp format**: Already fixed to use RFC3339 format

### UI/Templates
- **Minimal styling**: Basic HTML templates need CSS improvements
- **No error handling in templates**: Failed states not well displayed
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Not optimized for mobile devices

## üéØ Next Sprint Focus

1. **Session Management** (Critical)
   - Implement cookie-based sessions
   - Add logout button to all pages
   - Show current user in navbar
   - Secure session storage

2. **Trading Improvements**
   - Show price impact before trade confirmation
   - Add trade confirmation modal
   - Display current market probability prominently

3. **UI Polish**
   - Add basic CSS styling
   - Improve error messages
   - Add loading states
   - Mobile responsive design

## üìù Technical Debt

- Remove or migrate away from legacy `yes_pool`/`no_pool` fields
- Add proper error handling middleware
- Implement request validation layer
- Add integration tests for trading flows
- Document API endpoints
- Add deployment documentation

## üîÆ Future Exploration

- Hybrid AMM + Order Book (like current Polymarket)
- Cross-chain support
- Decentralized resolution (oracle integration)
- AI-powered market suggestions
- Social features (groups, challenges)
- Tournament/competition mode
